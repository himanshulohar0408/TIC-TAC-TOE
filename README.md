🧠 How the Game Works

The board consists of 9 clickable boxes.
Players take turns placing X and O.
After every move:
The game checks for a winning pattern.
If no winner is found and all boxes are filled, the game declares a draw.
Winning boxes are highlighted using CSS animations.
Players can restart the game at any time using Reset or New Game.
